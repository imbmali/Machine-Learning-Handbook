# Machine Learning Lab Practicals:

## Practical 1: Simple Linear Regression (Single Variable)

### Aim
To implement Simple Linear Regression using Python and Machine Learning libraries to predict the price of a house based on its area, and to visualize the relationship between area and price.

## Practical 2: Iris Dataset Exploration

### Aim
To set up the Python environment with Machine Learning libraries, load and explore the Iris dataset using Pandas, and create basic visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.
